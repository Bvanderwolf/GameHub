# GameHub

The game hub is meant as another step for me in the process of creating clean and optimal code. I do this by creating a simple game, trying to find the optimal ways to add functionalities along the way. Up until now the game hub contains 4 games. At the moment, the idea will be to further optimize these games and give them additional features.

## Hub Games

1. Tic-Tac-Toe: 2 player, turn based game in which players put an icon an icon on one of the 9 places on the board 
to create a horizontal, vertical or diagonal sequence. 

2. Snake: the well known snake game in which the player controls a snake, eating candies to get bigger.

3. Breakout: a game in which you have to bounce a ball against some tiles to eventualy break them and win.

4. MatchThree: a game in which the player shoots gems, sticking them to once on the screen and trying to destroy them by creating 
chains of gems. 

## Future ideas:

1. Tic-Tac-Toe: create a simple AI to play agains.

2. Snake: Add snake bots to destroy and other types of candies
